Approximates a given function by cesaro averages provided the function is Reimann Integrable and continuous in a given domain. 
Please consider looking at my poster `https://github.com/angrwl/Fejer-Theorem/edit/master/` and ipython notebooks `https://github.com/angrwl/Fejer-Theorem/edit/master/` or even the website I have created `https://github.com/angrwl/Fejer-Theorem/edit/master/` for a better understanding of **Fejer Theorem**
